# HomeWork06: This is a course manager app where the user can create instructors and have courses related to them. The app is purely based on 
fragments. Several recycler views are created which update if the user deletes or adds instructor or coure.
The data persists even after logging out. Realm database is used to maintain the user data. The back button functionality is taken care of.
